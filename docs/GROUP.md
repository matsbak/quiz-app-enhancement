# Group collaboration

This document describes how the group worked together and the group collaboration in general.

---

The group collaboration throughout the assignment was fine. No problems occured and the group
agreed early on how they wanted to do the assignment.

The group work however was a little unsynchronized as the group members worked on the assignment at
different paces. For example, one group member could be done with parts of the code before the
other. This was although not a problem since the group communicated well and discussed with each
other how the rest of the work would be carried out. In the end the group was satisfied with their
enchancement of the quiz app.
